/*
- A linked list is a tree that does not fork.
- Instead of pointing to next, it points to 2 nodes (left & right) = that makes it a BINARY tree.
- Some terminology: Full tree = every node either points to 0 or 2 nodes.
                    Perfect tree = any level in the tree that has any nodes is completely filled all the way across.
                    Complete tree = you fill the tree from left to right with no gap.
- Every node can only have one parent.
- A node that does not have children is called a leaf.
- A binary SEARCH tree is a binary tree in a particular way: the numbers greater than parent go to the right of the node
    and less than go to the left of that node. -- we always start at the top --
-if you take any node in a binary search tree, all nodes below it to the right are greater than that node and
                                               all nodes below it to the left are less than that node.

- Big O in BST: lookup() => O(log n) = divide & conquer = very efficient
         remove() => O(log n)
         insert() => O(log n)

- Big O in linked list: lookup() => O(n)
                        remove() => O(n)
                        insert()to the end => O(1)   FASTER WITH LINKED LIST
